IDA Pro 7.x Import and Export Scripts
-------------------------------------

**WARNING: this is still very experimental, we recommend copying your database to a 
new file before using these scripts!**


The `.csv` created by *Polypyus* can be imported with the `pp_import.py` script by calling it from IDA
via `File -> Script File -> ...`. Tested on IDA 7.2 with Python 2 and IDA 7.4 with Python 3.
